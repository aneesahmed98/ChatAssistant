Chat Assistant Project
This project is a Python-based chat assistant designed to help users interact with SQL queries easily. By communicating with the assistant, users can retrieve, add, update, or delete data from a database, all through natural language input. It is ideal for users who may not be familiar with SQL syntax and need a user-friendly interface to manage database interactions.

the question about who is manager will return no manager found because table has no such relevant data.
